# MACD Dashboard Scanner

This code represents an indicator for the MetaTrader 5 platform which calculates and displays the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the chart. The MACD is a popular technical indicator used by traders to identify potential trend reversals, generate trading signals, and determine the strength of a trend.

## Indicator Settings

- TimeFrame: The timeframe on which the MACD is calculated. By default, it uses the current timeframe.

- Slow_EMA_Period: The period used for the slow Exponential Moving Average (EMA) calculation. The default value is 26.
- Signal_SMA_Period: The period used for the Signal Simple Moving Average (SMA) calculation. The default value is 9.

## Indicator Initialization

During initialization, the indicator sets the style and buffer for plotting the MACD line on the chart.

## Indicator Calculation

The OnCalculate function is responsible for calculating the MACD values based on the input parameters. It uses the iMACD function provided by the MetaTrader 5 platform to calculate the MACD values for the specified timeframe. The calculated MACD values are then stored in the macdBuffer array.

## Additional Analysis

After calculating the MACD values, additional analysis or trading decisions can be performed based on the MACD values. This part of the code is left blank and can be customized according to the user's trading strategy.
